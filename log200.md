- SMK (https://github.com/nyguerrillagirl/super-mario-kart)
  - Worked on trying to get SMK to build 
  - Updated the Makefile for include and lib of SFML
  - Still not working error:

  C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/13.2.0/../../../../x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/ld.exe: .rsrc merge failure: duplicate leaf: type: 10 (VERSION) name: 1 lang: 409
  collect2.exe: error: ld returned 5 exit status
  make: *** [Makefile:57: ../super_mario_kart.exe] Error 1

  I don't know what it means!!

  Plan of Attack: Learn more C++, SFML and CMake  in order to help troubleshoot the issue. 
  My goal is to have this built by the end of my next 100 days
