  - STUCK on example used in course....
    - taking a deep dive on Context API. I had to review several examples
      in order to figure out what went wrong with the course example. They
      failed to show the student the final version of the UserContext file.
      Issue: Did not see anything on the screen after doing this:
          <UserProvider>
            <App />   
         </UserProvider>
      I failed to include {children} in the UserProvider!

### Day 153: February 26, 2025 (Wednesday)
- Working on Module 2/4 for course 5/9 [React Basics] in  [Meta Front-End Specialization] 
  - This is React Basics but the coverage of topics is quite poorly done.
    I noticed complaints from other students. I can't move on until I spend
    additional time:
    a) recreating the exercise (note: They don't provide resources!)
    b) processing tutorials and reading material 
- Java Book Club
  - Books Selected
     - Algorithms, 4th Edition by Sedgewick+Wayne
      - Working on Module 2/13 [Algorithms Part 1] Coursera Course 
      - I spent some time on Shuffle Algorithm and examined code
        provided by David on how he handled shuffling a linked list. The
        algorithm he provided was just dreadful. The solution should have been:
        a) copy linked list into an array
        b) perform Fisher-Yates (or Knuth Shuffle) Algorithm
        c) copy arry back into a linked list
- Books
  - Vol. 1/54 The Great Conversation 
- TTL4 Matches today
  - Viper lost 1-3 to Sebastian. I was rooting for Sebastian. I think at his best
    he shows Hera level play style.
  - Yo lost 1-3 to Dark.  I was rooting for Dark. Why? Let the younger folks shine.
