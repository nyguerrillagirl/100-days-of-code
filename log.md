### Day 5: October 1, 2024
-  Working on Zenva HTML5 + CSS3 course - Completed the Course
It was an archived course but I was able to start and finish it in four days.

I found a great article: [Learn CSS by Playing Games](https://medium.com/geekculture/learn-css-by-playing-games-cf70a79a38)
I will need to learn a bit more about CSS before pursuing some of these games. Like most courses
this one was very good but did not cover all the aspects of HTML5 and CSS 3. 
For example, It did not cover Flexbox and other CSS3 style rules.
