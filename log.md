### Day 29: October 25, 2024

- Started Module 3/4 (React) in Course 1/9 Meta Front-End Developer Specialization
- Completed Chapter 6 in Python Workshop
  - This chapter uses try:..except Exception: without having covered the topic in any previous chapter
    - I searched the book and have not found the topic covered at all!!
  - This chapter uses "import urllib" with no prior explanation of this library
  - Exercise 95 could not be completed because the file referenced at https://packt.live/2OOaXWs does not exist! I replaced it with
    "https://github.com/nyguerrillagirl/100-days-of-code/blob/main/FAQ.md"
  - The solution for the final Activity in Chapter 6 is wrong it should use partialmethod not partial. I hate this book.
  - The concept of a Workshop book (examples to follow with activity to test understanding) was very appealing
    but this book really sucks. The Activities are almost impossible. This book has the feel of multiple
    authors that did not coordinate better so that a construct used in one chapter was already covered
    in a previous one.
  - Another annoying aspect of the book is the fact that a single chapter (e.g. Chapter 4) can cover
    everything from file io to plotting graphs!? The graph plotting information is so sparse
    AND DOES NOT WORK to BOOT!!
  - I plan on completing the book only because I am stubborn and it is part of my 100-days-of-code
  - I did find out there is a 2nd Edition to the book. Hopefully (I seriously doubt it) the cleaned things up
