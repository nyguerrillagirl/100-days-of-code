# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 33: October 29, 2024
- Started working on Module 1/5 in Course 2 [Programming with JavaScript]/9 [Meta Front-End Specialization]
- Completed Chapter 3 of OReilly Course Bootstrap 5 From Scratch


### Day 32: October 28, 2024

- Completed 4 hours of the first part of the O'Reilly Learning course TCP/IP Dive with Wire Shark
- Completed Module 4/4 in Course 1 [Introduction to Fronend Development]/9 [Meta Front-End Specialization]

### Day 31: October 27, 2024

- Completed Chapter 2 of OReilly Course Bootstrap 5 From Scratch

### Day 30: October 26, 2024

- Completed Module 3/4 (React) in Course 1/9 [Meta Front-End Developer Specialization]
- Completed Chapter 1 of OReilly Course Bootstrap 5 From Scratch

### Day 29: October 25, 2024

- Started Module 3/4 (React) in Course 1/9 Meta Front-End Developer Specialization
- Completed Chapter 6 in Python Workshop
  - This chapter uses try:..except Exception: without having covered the topic in any previous chapter
    - I searched the book and have not found the topic covered at all!!
  - This chapter uses "import urllib" with no prior explanation of this library
  - Exercise 95 could not be completed because the file referenced at https://packt.live/2OOaXWs does not exist! I replaced it with
    "https://github.com/nyguerrillagirl/100-days-of-code/blob/main/FAQ.md"
  - The solution for the final Activity in Chapter 6 is wrong it should use partialmethod not partial. I hate this book.
  - The concept of a Workshop book (examples to follow with activity to test understanding) was very appealing
    but this book really sucks. The Activities are almost impossible. This book has the feel of multiple
    authors that did not coordinate better so that a construct used in one chapter was already covered
    in a previous one.
  - Another annoying aspect of the book is the fact that a single chapter (e.g. Chapter 4) can cover
    everything from file io to plotting graphs!? The graph plotting information is so sparse
    AND DOES NOT WORK to BOOT!!
  - I plan on completing the book only because I am stubborn and it is part of my 100-days-of-code
  - I did find out there is a 2nd Edition to the book. Hopefully (I seriously doubt it) the cleaned things up

### Day 5: October 1, 2024

  It was an archived course but I was able to start and finish it in four days.

I found a great article: [Learn CSS by Playing Games](https://medium.com/geekculture/learn-css-by-playing-games-cf70a79a38)
I will need to learn a bit more about CSS before pursuing some of these games. Like most courses
this one was very good but did not cover all the aspects of HTML5 and CSS 3.
For example, It did not cover Flexbox and other CSS3 style rules.
